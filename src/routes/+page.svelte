    <h2 id="more">About the Minto Pyramid</h2>
    <p>The Minto Pyramid Principle is a communication framework developed by Barbara Minto, a former McKinsey consultant. It helps people structure their ideas and communicate them clearly and effectively. It suggests that ideas should be presented in a logical and hierarchical order, with the main idea or conclusion at the top and then supporting it with smaller, related ideas or arguments arranged in descending order of importance. This structure gives rise to the name pyramid. The pyramid structure helps to ensure clarity and easy understanding of the message being communicated. The Minto Pyramid Principle has been widely adopted in business communication and consulting.</p>
